UPDATES:

* 23/01/21

1. Updated course table and made c_id as varchar. c_id now refers to dept_id + size(corresponding dept_id) + 1;
2. Tried to create a scenerio where user can select relevant course (not all the courses every time)
    - He can view courses of particular departments
    - Particular Semester
    - both

3. Department work done (edit department also working);
4. Removed one option from navbar ("see depts") as it was irrelevant.



ERRORS:

* 23/01/21
1. A query is broken (controllers => admin.js => postRelevantCourse) Kindly see
